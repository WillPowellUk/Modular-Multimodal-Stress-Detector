# Truly Modular Multimodal Stress Detection from Biosensor Measurements

Welcome to the **Modular Multimodal Stress Detection System**! 
This software accomanies my MsC project titled: Rethinking Stress Monitoring: Convenient Modular Early-Onset Multimodal Stress Detection with Attention Score Caching available [here](https://willpowell.uk/files/William_Powell_MSc_Thesis.pdf).

## ðŸª„ The Magic

We implement an architecture that has a:

- **Modular BCSA Mechanism**: Combines bidirectional cross-modal and self-attention networks to align multimodal sensor data and reduce noise, transforming each modality pair into an intermediate representation that enables any number and combination of modality to be used.  
- **Novel Bidirectional Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Enhances temporal context by allowing embeddings from past signals to re-attend to new data, improving prediction accuracy by dynamically updating the significance of previous information.
- **Sliding Attention Score Caching Mechanism**: Caches attention scores and projections to enable efficient real-time sequence-to-sequence predictions without recomputing past data.  
- **Predictor**: Fuses modality-specific outputs using ensemble methods, including hard voting, soft voting, and Kalman filter for real-time temporal updates.

The model supports both unimodal and multimodal inputs, adapting dynamically by inferring only relevant cross-attention blocks, optimizing latency for real-time applications.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ§ **Mastoid-based sEMG & EEG Integration**
- Discreet, headphone-based stress monitoring.
- Measures muscle and brain activity through the mastoid area.
- ðŸ§  sEMG and EEG biomarkers help identify stress but are subject to noise challenges.

### ðŸ’¡ **Pre-frontal Cortex fNIRS (Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)**
- A portable, consumer-friendly modality for monitoring brain oxygenation.
- Highly predictive features but sensitive to individual variability.
  
### ðŸ“ˆ **Modular, Multimodal Architecture**
- Adaptable to various device combinations: sEMG, EEG, and fNIRS.
- Ensemble of cross-attention and self-attention blocks ensure temporal alignment of signals from different devices.
- Minimal performance drop (-2%) when switching between modalities or using only specific ones.

### ðŸš€ **High Efficiency with Sequence-to-Sequence Attention**
- Reduced stress detection window size by 5x using attention score caching.
- Optimized for faster processing with minimal computational complexity.

### ðŸ§  **Personalization Capabilities**
- Personalization techniques to mitigate participant variability.
- Tailored learning for improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead.

### ðŸ›  **Dataset & Testing**
- **MUSED Dataset**: Novel dataset for stress detection with innovative device integration.
- Tested on well-known datasets like **WESAD** and **UBFC-Phys**, ensuring robust performance across various stress monitoring modalities.

### ðŸ“Š **Performance Highlights**
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with minimal computation.
- True modularity between modalities with high generalization performance across different sensor configurations.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To start, create a new virtual enviroment or conda environment and install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You may have to download and setup CUDA related packages (such as those linked with PyTorch) specifically for your device.

### Demo
To run the demo, view the [wesad_deom.ipynb](wesad_demo.ipynb) which takes you through downloading the WESAD dataset and running the whole pipeline.
