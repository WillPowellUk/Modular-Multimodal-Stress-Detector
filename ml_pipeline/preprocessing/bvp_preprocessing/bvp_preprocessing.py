'''
BVP signal is filtered by a Butterworth band-pass filter of order
3 with cutoff frequencies (f1 = 0.7 Hz and f2 = 3.7 Hz),
which takes into account the heart rate at rest (≈40 BPM)
or high heart rate due to exercise scenarios or tachycardia
(≈220 BPM) - Stress Detection Using Context-Aware Sensor
